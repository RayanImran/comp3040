Dear Stewart,

It was a pleasure studying with you this term. You did an excellent job, and I had a great time! This course has been extremely valuable and instructive. This email contains a brief review of the course, divided into three sections, as well as my understanding of the course material. It also shows how I critically engaged with course material, particularly the assignments, and it serves as a reflection of my learning throughout the course. 

# Writing Format

The course's writing process insights have improved my overall writing abilities, I feel more confident in my writing now that I've mastered these components. While it goes without saying that when creating documentation, keep the audience in mind. Rewriting and the ABC method have proven to be effective in my writing. It has also been demonstrated that frequently using transitions between sentences is a very effective writing style. In terms of practicing all these skills, the first assignment was extremely beneficial. We discussed the audience, the ABC format, and transitions, and did a lot of modifying while working in groups. This assignment also gave us ideas for how our professional emails should appear in the future and how we should construct them. Overall, this content was clear and useful.

# Documentation for Computer Scientists

The second topic that I would like to highlight is the documentation for Computer Scientists, which included a variety of software and documentation tools used in modern technical writing. Andrew Etter's book 'Modern Technical Writing' was extremely helpful. When Markdown was first introduced to us, I thought it was a simple yet powerful tool for creating beautiful static websites. Static websites are essential for hosting our website online. This topic's homework reiterates all of Etter's principles highlighted in his book. We created a résumé in Markdown and hosted it on GitHub pages. This assignment showed me how to successfully upload my resume as a static website. 

# Overview of APIs and API Documentation

The course's final section covered the current industry standard for API documentation. This topic provided us with strong fundamental knowledge. The OAS appeared difficult at first glance, but the in-class demonstration helped me get used to the concept and understand it. We also looked at an API and its documentation in class. Although I did have general ideas about APIs, reviewing sample documentation helped me better understand how to describe APIs in the future. The in-class sessions clarified the OAS code using the provided YAML file samples on the Swagger editor. The course did an excellent job of introducing us to industry standards and increasing my confidence in my technical writing abilities to the point where becoming a technical writer appears to be a realistic goal. Furthermore, the course's emphasis on peer review and group work made the more difficult aspects of it feel manageable. I would recommend this course to all students in Computer Science 

Sincerely,

Rayan Imran
