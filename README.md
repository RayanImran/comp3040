Dear Stewart,
It was a pleasure studying the following important ideas with you this term. You did an excellent job, and I had a great time! This course has been extremely valuable and instructive. I had a great time with you, and I hope you did as well. This email contains a brief review of the course, divided into three sections, as well as my understanding of the course material. It also shows how I critically engaged with course material, particularly the assignments, and it serves as a reflection of my learning throughout the course. 

# Writing Format

The course's writing process insights have improved my overall writing skills, and now that I've mastered these elements, I'm more confident in my writing. While it goes without saying that when creating documentation, keep the audience in mind. Rewriting and the ABC method have proven to be effective in my writing. It has also been demonstrated that frequently using transitions between sentences is a very effective writing style. In terms of practicing all these skills, the first project was extremely beneficial. We discussed the audience, the ABC format, and transitions, and did a lot of modifying while working in groups. This exercise also gave us an idea of how our professional emails should look in the future. And how they should be written Overall, this material was very clear and informative.

# Documentation for Computer Scientists

The second topic covered documentation, which included a variety of software and documentation tools used in modern technical writing. Andrew Etter's book 'Modern Technical Writing' was extremely helpful. When Markdown was first introduced to us, I thought it was a simple yet powerful tool for creating beautiful static websites. Static websites are essential for hosting our content because storing it on a hard disc is becoming increasingly obsolete. This topic's homework reiterates all of Etter's principles. We created a résumé in Markdown and hosted it on GitHub pages. This assignment showed me how these three factors are intertwined. In conclusion, this topic, particularly Andrew Etter's book, provided valuable insight into a variety of areas of technical writing.

# Overview of APIs and API Documentation

The course's final section covered the current industry standard for API documentation. We were now prepared for a more complex software stack because we had mastered the fundamentals. The OAS appeared difficult at first glance, but the in-class demonstration helped me get used to the concept and understand the code. We also looked at an API and its documentation in class. Although I was not unfamiliar with APIs, reviewing sample documentation helped me better understand how to describe APIs in the future. The assignment 3 clarified the OAS code using the provided YAML file samples as well. The course did an excellent job of introducing us to industry standards and increasing my confidence in my technical writing abilities to the point where becoming a technical writer appears to be a realistic goal. Furthermore, the course's emphasis on peer review and group work made the more difficult aspects of it feel manageable. I would definitely recommend this course to my peers if they want to master the art of technical communication.

Sincerely,
Rayan Imran
